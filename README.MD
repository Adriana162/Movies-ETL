#ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

###Purpose

The purpose of this project is to implement the ETL process by using Python and Pandas to merge several data sources and
Postgres SQL to store the data. Once the data is extracted with Python, it is cleaned and transformed with Pandas. Then the data is loaded
with PostgresSQL.
